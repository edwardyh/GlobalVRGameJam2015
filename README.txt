This repository is for Global VR Game Jam 2015.

The theme is:
HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION

The Google Cardboard SDK is included (imported) into the Assets folder.

Two Git Tutorials are included in the repository as well:
- Git_cheat_sheet.pdf <- A summary of most of the common commands.
- Git_Tutorial.pdf  <- The contents are very CPSC310 specific, but still helpful.
